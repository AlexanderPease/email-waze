Staff members have some special powers.

1. Ability to 'mute' a given share. This prevents the share from being visible in the 'hot' list (does it also remove it from other views?)

2. Ability to bump up the score for a given share. This helps move the item up the 'hot' list.

3. Ability to bump down the score for a given share. This helps move the item down the 'hot' list.

4. Ability to 'blacklist' a given user. This hides the user and all their shares in the system. It also prevents the user from adding new shares.

5. Ability to remove a given user from the blacklist.

6. Be alerted, via email, of shares by other staff members.

7. Have special weighting within the 'hot' list for their shares. Additionally, the ability to have multiple items within the 'hot' list on a given page.

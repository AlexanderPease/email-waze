The following describes a bit about the organization structure of this project:

/app

Where business logic sits (controllers)...as much as possible we should have one script per type of business logic (ie. account stuff in account.py, search stuff in search.py).

The basic.py file should be imported into each class in these files, so all of the methods defined in it are also available to our controller code (this is where reusable actions for controllers like actually sending email and such should be defined)

/documentation

Where all genearl documentation (like this) should be stored.

/db

Where all database calls and logic sits (models)...this is also a good location for any custom helper dbraries that we want our scripts to have available (template_helpers.py for example)

/scripts

Where any support scripts (that would execute outside of the normal web site) should be stored. This is also the folder where data load scripts and database maint. scripts should be stored.

/static

Where all the images, css, js and other things that can be called directly via nginx should go 

TODO: a cleanup on the static folder down the road too -- lots in here that probably isn't used.

/templates

Where all the html files go (views). As much as possible we want to avoid having business logic in this level and so everything here should just be focused on display to the user. For simplicity and long term management we should create one sub folder for each 'controller' found in the app folder.

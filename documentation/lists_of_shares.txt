There are a number of ways that a user can view a list of 'shares' in the system.

1. Hot - Currently calculated via a cron job run every 5 minutes. Meant to order shares by a combination of time, votes, and active conversation.

Normal users can only have one item per page appear in the 'hot' list, while 'staff' are not limited to the same restriction. Staff also get a small bonus bump for each share (making their shares more likely to be in the 'hot' list than others).

The specific calculation is:

2. Newest - date sorted list of shares. No other restrictions applied.

3. Featured - staff members have the ability to mark any post as 'featured'. Featured lists are then date sorted (newest first), and appear on the home page in the 'featured' column.

4. Tagged - date sorted list of shares that have a given tag. No restrictions apply.

5. User shares - date sorted list of shares a given user has added to the system. No restrictions apply.

6. Tagged by user shares - date sorted list of shares that include a given tag the given user has added to the system. No restrictions apply.

7. @ mentions - date sorted list of shares a given user has been @ mentioned within the body post of. No restrictions apply.
